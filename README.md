# Coursera Subtitle Extension

Hello, this is a project to change the language of courses subtitles because I noticed that many people have trouble due to the lack of subtitles in their native language. I thought to myself that I could create a subtitle translator using Google Translate API

## Setup
- Download the project
- Open your browser add-ons.
- Activate the Developer mode.
- Click on install packaged item.
- Select the folder you downloaded.
- Installation complete.
- After opening the course video, select the language and press the translate button.
- DONE
